Let's make a Travel Map!

Monday, January 22 @ 6:30pm<br>
Studious Coworking Space<br>
418 Bamboo Lane

Happy New Year!  The theme for our first MaptimeLA meeting of 2024 is TRAVEL!  We will be making a list of all the destinations on our bucket list and pinning them in QGIS.  Then, we will export the finished map into a website that you can share with friends and family!  Beginners are always welcome!
