# qgis-101-travel-map

Let's make a Travel Map!

Monday, January 22 @ 6:30pm<br>
Studious Coworking Space<br>
418 Bamboo Lane

Happy New Year!  The theme for our first MaptimeLA meeting of 2024 is TRAVEL!  We will be making a list of all the destinations on our bucket list and pinning them in QGIS.  Then, we will export the finished map into a website that you can share with friends and family!  Beginners are always welcome!

## Intro to GitHub

### What is GitHub?

An online "hub" where people share, collaborate, and build on top of each others' work.

Usually used by programmers for open source code, but it can handle all sorts of files!

Open Source means that your work is publicly shared for others to use for free.  Different types of open source licenses - some you can change it as long as you give attribution, others you can't use make money.

### How To Use GitHub

Within your account, you can create projects - those are called "repositories," or "repos" for short.  You can choose to make it private or public.  Even if you make it public, that doesn't mean anyone can go in and change your repo without your approval.

Maybe you put something up and someone finds a typo.  What they might do is "fork" your repo (make a copy of it on their own account), make changes to their copy, and then open a "pull request" (a request to combine their changes back into your copy).

Let's say you have a group of people you're collaborating with - you can also give them access to your repo so they can make changes without requesting approval first.  What's great is that GitHub also uses a version control system (that's "git") to track what changes were made and who made them.  You can also undo the changes in case you want to roll back to a previous version.
