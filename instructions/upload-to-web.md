# Upload to Web

After you've generated your webfiles in QGIS, you're ready to upload them to the web so that everyone can view your creation!

Log in to GitHub (https://github.com) and go to the workshop repository: https://github.com/maptimeLA/qgis-101-travel-map/

## Basic intro to GitHub

### What is GitHub?

An online "hub" where people share, collaborate, and build on top of each others' work.

Usually used by programmers for open source code, but it can handle all sorts of files!

Open Source means that your work is publicly shared for others to use for free.  Different types of open source licenses - some you can change it as long as you give attribution, others you can't use make money.

### How To Use GitHub

Within your account, you can create projects - those are called "repositories," or "repos" for short.  You can choose to make it private or public.  Even if you make it public, that doesn't mean anyone can go in and change your repo without your approval.

Maybe you put something up and someone finds a typo.  What they might do is "fork" your repo (make a copy of it on their own account), make changes to their copy, and then open a "pull request" (a request to combine their changes back into your copy).

Let's say you have a group of people you're collaborating with - you can also give them access to your repo so they can make changes without requestingi approval first.  What's great is that GitHub also uses a version control system (that's "git") to track what changes were made and who made them.  You can also undo the changes in case you want to roll back to a previous version.
